// ---------------- status.ts — Wisp: the statusline snapshot (context reading + quota meters) ---------------- //

/*
 * Depends on:
 *   - ./catalog — the Provider row type ONLY (import type, erased at runtime), same one-way rule as codex.ts.
 *   - ./shared — BridgeUsage, the real token counts every Provider now reports (#165 + #169).
 *   - ./codex / ./anthropic / ./xai — the kind guards + the OFFLINE model-window tables.
 *
 * Data shapes:
 *   - QuotaMeter: one utilization window, normalized to a 0..100 percent whatever the wire said.
 *   - WispStatus: what the Bridge drops in ~/.wisp/status.json after a bridged turn, and the statusline
 *     script reads back. Every field past updatedAt/providerId/model is OPTIONAL on purpose — a missing
 *     field renders as a missing field, never as a zero (#171: a fabricated reading is worse than a blank).
 *   - WispProviderQuota: one REMEMBERED Provider's last meters, kept in the `providers` ledger so a route
 *     switch does not erase what the other wire last said about itself.
 *
 * The two upstreams report utilization in different shapes and different UNITS (Anthropic a 0..1 fraction
 * over named windows, Codex an integer percent over primary/secondary whose size only *-window-minutes
 * reveals). Both are normalized here so the statusline renders one vocabulary, and neither parser guesses:
 * a header that isn't there produces no meter at all.
